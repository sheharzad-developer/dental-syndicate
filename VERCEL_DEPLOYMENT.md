## üîß Changes Made for Vercel Compatibility

### **Files Added:**
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- ‚úÖ `api/index.py` - Serverless Flask app
- ‚úÖ `api/requirements.txt` - Dependencies for serverless functions

### **Key Modifications:**

#### **1. Serverless Architecture**
- Converted Flask app to work with Vercel's serverless functions
- All routes now handled through `/api/index.py`

#### **2. SMS/WhatsApp Changes**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Background tasks (SMS/WhatsApp notifications) are **disabled** in Vercel deployment because:
- Serverless functions don't support threading
- 10-second execution limit
- No persistent processes

**What happens now:**
- Appointment forms still work perfectly
- Data is logged to Vercel function logs
- You'll need to manually check appointments or integrate with external services

#### **3. Alternative Notification Options:**
To restore notifications, you can integrate with:
- **Zapier** - Connect form submissions to SMS/email
- **Airtable** - Store appointments in a database
- **EmailJS** - Send email notifications
- **Twilio** - SMS service via webhooks
